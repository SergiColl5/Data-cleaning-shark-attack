Are sharks Machists?
I guess this is a question that everyone is wanting to know the answer for. 

The porpouse of this project is to analyse the data of shark attacks and resolve this interrogant once and for all.

To begin, I will present a summary of the data I am going to use. so we understand the capabilities of this study and its results.
The data set contains around 3500 incidents that apparently involved these giant fishes. For each case, we managed to gather infomation about where in the world happened, the date, the time of the day, the sex of the victim, their age, the activities they were doing, 
if they survived, and also a link to an article related to the case.

After taking a look at this data set and clean it. I wanted to see if there is an existing pattern on the behaviour of the sharks in terms of chosing the victim. In this case, if the sex of the victim has any impact on the shark's behaviour.

I listed four hipotesis to help me undesrtand the patterns.

1. Female victims have a higher likelihood of being attacked in countries with a higher frequency of shark attacks, compared to male victims.

2. The species of shark that attacks female victims is different from the species that attacks male victims. 

3. Female victims have a higher likelihood to suffer a letal attack, compared to male victims.

4. The ratio of female vs male incidents vary depending on the country.


These hipotesis will drive my investigation and will lead us to understand if sharks are machists or not, if there is a specific species that it's still stuck in the last century, if sharks are more machists in an specific areas of the world, and if the sharks tend
to be more agressive against women.
